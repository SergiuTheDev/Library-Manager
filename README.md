# Project Description: Library System

This Library System project is designed to manage a collection of books, authors, and users in a user-friendly manner. The main objective is to provide functionalities for borrowing and returning books, managing authors, and overseeing users.

Key Features:

Book Management: Users can borrow and return books. Each book has a title, publication year, author, type, and availability status.

Author Management: Authors can be added to the library system, and their associated books can be tracked.

User Management: Users can borrow books and maintain a list of borrowed books. The system checks the availability of books before allowing a borrow action.

Library Operations: The library can add or remove books and authors, show available books, list borrowed books, and manage user registrations.

This project displays basic use of classes, methods, and object-oriented programming principles.
